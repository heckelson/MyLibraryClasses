# MyLibraryClasses
A couple C++ classes I put together for practice.

There's a couple of boost unit tests that I created to just test the classes a little.

### Future plans

Maybe in the future I'll add some other data structures such as:

* Hashset and/or Hashmap
* Queues and/or Deques
* Linked lists
* Heap
* ...
